# SteamHourBoostWebInterface
To Install run 

`wget -O - https://raw.githubusercontent.com/p410n3/SteamHourBoostWebInterface/master/install.sh | bash`

as root. Then you need to do the following
    
    - `coffee /var/steamhourboostv2/user.coffee` to add a steam account
    - go to /var/SteamHourBoostWebInterface/interface and change the config.php to use your data to login.
    - move the databse.json from /root/ to /var/steamhourboostv2 (Working for a fix for that)
